## Basic Fire and Integrate model
In the case of external constant injection of current I, corresponding Voltage outcomes (including a calculation of theoretical and average spiking rates) are graphed.

## Hodgkin-Huxley Fire and Integrate model
The hodgkin-huxley neuron model models the voltage and time dependent conductance of channels, adding complexity to the fire and integrate model of the neuron.

In the case of external constant injection of current I, corresponding Hodgkin-Huckley variables are plotted against time.
